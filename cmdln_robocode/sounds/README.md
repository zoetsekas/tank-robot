# Sound files available for the GUI application

This entire sound directory including all files needs to be copied into the directory containing your
`robocode-tankroyale-gui-x.y.z.jar` file, i.e. as a directory containing all sound files next to the jar file like this:

```
[your tank royale directory]
├── robocode-tankroyale-gui-x.y.z.jar
└── sounds/  <-- this directory
    ├── bots_collision.wav
    ├── bullet_hit.wav
    ...
    └── wall_collision.wav    
```
